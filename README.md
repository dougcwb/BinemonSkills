## Why is this extension not in Google Chrome Web Store?
This is an Extension with Manifest version 2, and since 2020, all uploaded extensions should be uploaded as Manifest version 3. I still didn't have time to "upgrade" the code to v3. If you want to help us with that, be my guest and contact me so we can publish a v3 Manifest to Chrome Web Store.
